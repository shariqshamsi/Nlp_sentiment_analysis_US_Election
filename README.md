# NLP Sentiment Analysis for US Election
In this project, I analyze the sentiment of text data related to the US election, focusing on tweets. This demonstrates my use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for sentiment analysis, aiming to understand the overall sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed towards the US election.
